# BT Cam 3.3.0: The Ultimate Multi-Camera App for Weddings and Ceremonies

Managing multiple cameras during **weddings,  or ceremonies** is no easy task. You’re trying to capture every angle, ensure everything is recording, and avoid technical mishaps—all while staying invisible in the moment.

**BT Cam 3.3.0** changes that.

Whether you're filming a once-in-a-lifetime ceremony or a packed festival stage, this update gives you the tools to stay in control, stay mobile, and never miss a shot.

## 🎬 What’s New in 3.3.0?

This update brings a suite of highly requested features designed especially for **event videographers**:

* **Elapsed Recording Time:** See exactly how long each camera has been rolling.
* **Session Logs:** Automatically log every start/stop across all cameras—and export it when you're done.
* **Smoother Multi-Camera Sync:** Better coordination for simultaneous start/stop across different camera brands.
* **Shutter via Volume Buttons:** Trigger the shutter without looking at your screen—ideal when you're on the move.
* **Improved Canon Setup:** Updated guidance and clearer error messaging.
* **System Pairing Preference:** Choose system-level Bluetooth pairing for greater compatibility.

> These upgrades are the result of real-world feedback from wedding shooters, live music pros, and documentary filmmakers who rely on multi-camera setups every week.

## 📸 The Multi-Cam Problem: Fragmented, Clunky, Risky

If you're shooting with a combo of **Sony, GoPro, Canon**, or **Panasonic**, you’re likely using **multiple apps**—none of which talk to each other. That means:

* ❌ No live status view of all cameras
* ❌ Time lost physically checking each device
* ❌ Risk of missing moments if a camera stops recording
* ❌ Manual syncing during post-production
* ❌ Endless app switching

It’s not just frustrating—it’s inefficient and prone to mistakes.

## ✅ The BT Cam Solution: Unified, Reliable, Event-Proven

**BT Cam** is built to solve these exact problems. With support for **all major camera brands**—including Sony, Nikon, Canon, GoPro, Panasonic, Fuji, Olympus, Blackmagic, and Pentax—you can finally **control and monitor everything from one app**.

### Centralized Monitoring

* **Live Camera View:** Instantly check which cameras are recording and how long they've been rolling.
* **One-Tap Control:** Start or stop recording across all connected cameras at once—or control them individually as needed.
* **Clean Interface:** Built for speed and clarity in fast-paced environments like ceremonies and shows.

### Automated Logging for Faster Editing

* **Automatic Time Logs:** Every recording session is timestamped.
* **Exportable Logs:** Bring precise data into your editor to align footage quickly.
* **Never Miss a Take:** Logs double as insurance against human error.

### Designed for the Field

* **Shutter via Volume Buttons:** Keep your eyes on the moment, not your phone screen.
* **More Bluetooth Flexibility:** Prefer system pairing for improved reliability with certain models.

> With BT Cam 3.3.0, you're no longer tied to your gear—you’re empowered by it.

## 🎥 Why It Matters for Event Videographers

Whether you're shooting a 3-camera wedding ceremony, a 2-camera stage performance, or a documentary with roaming angles, **BT Cam is your mobile command center**.

* 💒 **Weddings:** Quietly trigger cameras from the back of the event hall.
* 🎓 **Ceremonies:** Start/stop multiple cameras without distracting the moment.
* ⏱️ **Stay in control:** Monitor status and time at a glance.
