# BT Cam 3.5: It’s About Time

This one’s all about timing.

With **BT Cam 3.5**, we’re introducing powerful new tools for photographers and filmmakers who want more control over when — and how — their shots are taken. Whether you just need a quick delay, a hands-free time-lapse setup, or a fully scripted sequence of shots, it’s all built right in.

---

## 🕓 Simple Timer — Classic and Easy

Sometimes all you need is a quick delay before the shutter fires.

The **Simple Timer** works just like the timer on your phone’s camera. Set a short countdown, tap the shutter, and get in position. It's perfect for:

* Solo portraits
* Group shots without a remote
* Minimizing shake on long exposures

Fast, familiar, and built for those no-fuss moments.

## ⏱ Advanced Timer — Full Control Over Intervals

When you need a bit more power, the **Advanced Timer** gives you fine-grained control over your entire shooting sequence:

* Set the **interval** between each shot
* Define a precise **exposure time** (works with bulb mode)
* Choose a **number of shots**, or shoot continuously

Perfect for:

* **Star trails**
* **Timelapses**
* **Light painting**
* Any creative sequence that needs consistent timing

---

## 🎬 Script Timer — Program Every Shot

The new **Script Timer** lets you schedule your entire shoot ahead of time.

You can:

* Trigger actions at **exact times**
* Set custom **exposure lengths**
* Add notes or instructions for each step
* Export & import scripts for future use

It’s like a playlist for your camera — just hit go and let it run.

Ideal for:

* **Eclipse photography**
* **Nightscapes or astro timelapses**
* **Scientific observations**
* Long sessions where timing is critical

## 🎥 For Videographers: Custom Video Time Limits

Many hybrid cameras have a frustrating time limit on video recording — often 30 minutes — and worse, they don’t even report when they stop.

That’s where **Custom Video Time Limits** comes in.

Now you can:

* Manually set your camera’s known video time limit
* Let BT Cam **automatically stop and restart recording** when that time is reached
* Capture uninterrupted footage without babysitting your gear

This is built specifically for:

* **Event videographers**
* **Wedding shooters**
* **Live show and stage recordings**
* **Podcast and content creators**

No more missed footage. No more guesswork. Just smooth, continuous takes — even with the most limiting gear.
